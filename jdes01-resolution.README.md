Ok! so this is my very first attempt at resolving this backend code test. Here I'll try to explain as detailed as I can every decision I make. Wish me luck I guess.

## Stage 1:
- First of all, even tho I consider it as a bit of over-engineering, I'll dockerize the test. It might be useful later on, specially when dealing w/ mongo.
- I modified a bit the package.json so watch-node auto-refreshes my code while working on it.
